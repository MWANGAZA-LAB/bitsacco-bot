# GitHub Pages Setup Guide - Fix README.md Issue

## Current Problem
You're seeing the README.md file instead of the admin dashboard at `https://mwangaza-lab.github.io/bitsacco-bot/`

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages is not enabled in your repository settings, so it's serving the default repository content instead of the deployed admin dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/MWANGAZA-LAB/bitsacco-bot/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Re-run the Deployment
1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/MWANGAZA-LAB/bitsacco-bot/actions
   ```

2. **Find and re-run the workflow:**
   - Look for "ðŸš€ Deploy Admin Dashboard to GitHub Pages"
   - Click "Re-run jobs" button

## Expected Result
After enabling GitHub Pages and re-running the workflow:
- âœ… Dashboard will be available at: `https://mwangaza-lab.github.io/bitsacco-bot/`
- âœ… You'll see the React admin dashboard (not README.md)
- âœ… All dashboard features will work properly

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see README.md:
1. **Check if GitHub Pages is enabled:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Should show "Your site is live at https://mwangaza-lab.github.io/bitsacco-bot/"

2. **Check workflow status:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Look for successful deployment of "Deploy Admin Dashboard to GitHub Pages"

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### If workflow fails:
1. **Check the deployment logs** in the Actions tab
2. **Ensure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions"** (not branch deployment)
3. **Verify the repository has Pages permissions**

## Technical Details

### Why this happens:
- GitHub Pages defaults to serving repository content when not configured
- The admin dashboard is built and deployed via GitHub Actions
- Without Pages enabled, the Actions deployment doesn't serve the content

### What the workflow does:
1. Builds the React admin dashboard
2. Uploads build artifacts
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages (when enabled)

## Verification Steps
1. âœ… GitHub Pages enabled in settings
2. âœ… Workflow deployment successful
3. âœ… Dashboard accessible at correct URL
4. âœ… React app loads (not README.md)

## Support
If issues persist after following these steps, check:
- GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Repository permissions and settings
- Browser developer tools for any console errors
